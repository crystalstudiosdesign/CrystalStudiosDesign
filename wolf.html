		<h1>The Printing Process</h1>
			<p>
				The decision I took with these cards, I've only ever done with my first personal business cards; which is to print on plastic to create 100% transparency. I really enjoy trying to find a different approach for my designs. I personally haven't seen very many transparent cards, so people are taken back a bit to see something they may haven't before. Since the cards are see through, they have to stand out on their own just as they do in a stack.
