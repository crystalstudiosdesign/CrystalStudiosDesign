		<h1>Self Started Works</h1>
			<p>
				I believe it's always important to do work oustide of work. To always keep your skills sharpened, or to be learning new ones. These are all projects I did for that reason. I'm always wanting to learn more, and how to achieve what I want. Doing assignments in class is one thing, but to take something you've messing around with and get it out in form is something I find quite rewarding.
