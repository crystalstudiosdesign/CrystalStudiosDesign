		<h1>Mason Jar Restaurant </h1>
			<p>
				This was an amazing opportunity, and I enjoyed it too much. I really look forward to doing more work like this for future clients. I was asked to come up with a whole brand identity for a restaurant that would feature live music outside. They had a really nice atmosphere planned out, simple menu and nice sipping drinks. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Unfortunately, the owners were unable to continue with the restaurant and had to stop the whole project. I did however get paid for my design work. But I was more interested in the fact that, I would have my own design on everything that restaurant would have facilitated. That is what I find so intoxicating about design.

		<h3>Below are some pictures for the concept of the brand.</h3>

			This was a draft of what the condensed version would look like. From paper and pencil, to pixels and tablet!
