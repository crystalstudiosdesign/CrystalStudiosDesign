		<h1>My Process</h1>
			<p>
				When I'm given an opportunity to showcase what I have to offer, I typically will try and meet face to face for the first time. I find the one-on-one time is important to show that you are commited and willing to work with the client. I then have a short questionaire of no more than 10 questions for the potential client. I use that information to further my understanding of what they want even before research has started. It also lets us both be on the same page about what direction the job should go. 
			</p>

			<p>
				After the meeting, I start reseaching and rough sketches. After going over the concepts with the client, I then transfer my drawing digitally and then begin digitizing the concepts. Once I finish, whether it be for print or web, I contact my client, send the files to be looked over or meet in person if printed, and close the contract! Obviously it's not so cut and dry, but that's been my general outline.
