				Hi! My name is Yousef. And that pretty diamond up there is the logo for my freelance business Crystal Studios Design. I'm crazy about Branding Identity...but I've been seeing some Product Packaging and Advertisement on the side..shh!
			</p> 

			<p>
				The reason I'm so smitten with design is simply the ability to create. To create well enough that your design is on the invoices of a new small business, or on the business cards of a corporation. To be able to walk down the street, and just stare at the window ads you made for a business. That's what I truly enjoy.

				Born in Kansas, raised in few places before landing in Missouri. Healthy obsession with pugs, and cats. But I have it under control..
